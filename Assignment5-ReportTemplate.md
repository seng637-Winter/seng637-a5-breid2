# Introduction

# 

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 
Testing for this assessment used C-SFRAT, and followed the steps outlined in the paper "A covariate software tool to guide test activity allocation". Thus Weibull (DW2), Geometric (GM), and second order negative binomial (NB2) were used as models. The comparison using Critic Mean showed the best models to be GM with covariate F (Critic score of 1.000), and GM with covariates F, C (Critic score of 0.981).
